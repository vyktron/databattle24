## DataBase

Unzip the `db/db_backup_plateforme_2024-01-10_010001.zip` archive and put the `db_backup_plateforme_2024-01-10_010001.sql` file in the `db` folder.

## Compose

To start the project, you need to have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine.

Then, you can run `docker compose up` to start the project.

## Requirements

If you want to run the project without Docker, you need to install the requirements by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` (do it in a virtual environment !).

## Troubleshooting

In case you have already a MySQL server running on your machine, you can stop it by running `sudo service mysql stop` on Linux
